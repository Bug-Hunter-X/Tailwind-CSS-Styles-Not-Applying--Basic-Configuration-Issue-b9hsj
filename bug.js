```javascript
// in your main app.js file or wherever you initialize tailwind
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

// ... your other styles
```
This is the most basic setup of Tailwind CSS.  If you're missing this or have a typo in these lines, Tailwind's CSS won't be applied correctly.  Make sure the pathing is correct to your `tailwind.config.js` file as well.  Also ensure that Tailwind's base styles aren't being overridden inadvertently.
