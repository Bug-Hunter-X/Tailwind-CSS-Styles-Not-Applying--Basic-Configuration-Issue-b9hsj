```javascript
// in your main app.js file or wherever you initialize tailwind
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Other styles can go here */
```
This corrected version adds the crucial `@tailwind` directives. Without them, Tailwind's generated CSS isn't included in the project's styles.  Ensure that your pathing is correct to your `tailwind.config.js` file as well.
