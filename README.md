# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying: Basic Configuration Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue when setting up Tailwind CSS: the styles not being applied due to a missing or incorrectly configured `@tailwind` directives in your main CSS file.  This simple example helps in understanding and resolving this basic, yet frequently encountered, problem.

## Problem

After properly installing and configuring Tailwind CSS, no styles are being applied to HTML elements. This typically means a core Tailwind setup step was missed or is configured incorrectly.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `@tailwind` directives are correctly placed and that Tailwind's `config.js` file is correctly configured and accessible to your CSS.

## How to Reproduce (bug.js)

1.  Create a basic HTML structure.
2.  Set up your css file without the @tailwind directives. This will cause the bug.
3.  Make sure Tailwind is installed, and `tailwind.config.js` exists, but the `@tailwind` directives are absent from the main CSS file.  No styles will be applied.

## How to Fix (bugSolution.js)

1. Correctly add the `@tailwind` directives into your main CSS file to correctly include the base, components, and utilities files from Tailwind. 
2. Verify `tailwind.config.js` is properly configured and the path in your CSS file is correct. 

By following the provided solution, you'll successfully apply Tailwind CSS styles to your project.
